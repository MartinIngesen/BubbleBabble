# BubbleBabble

>In computing, Bubble Babble is a binary data encoding designed by Antti Huima. This encoding uses alternation of consonants and vowels to encode binary data to pseudowords that can be pronounced more easily than arbitrary lists of hexadecimal digits. While Bubble Babble is technically a binary encoding, it also acts as a 65,536-digit positional number system with a one-to-one mapping from each five-character sequence to 16 bits of data.

>Bubble babble also includes a checksum in its encoding to detect transmission errors, as well as markers for the start and end of a number string. Each two bytes in the input sequence results in the output of five characters and a dash.
